## Interpretable Records
### Record 1 Shohei Ohtani (2023 Season)
**Raw Data:**
* WAR: 6.0
* OBP: .412
* SLG: .654
* PA: 599
* Hits: 151
* Home Runs: 44

Interpretation:** Shohei Ohtaniâ€™s statistics reflect his dual-threat ability as both a hitter and a pitcher. In this dataset, his WAR of 6.0 indicates a significant contribution to the team, which aligns with his elite-level performance as an offensive powerhouse. His OBP of .412 and SLG of .654 indicate excellent plate discipline and slugging power, making him one of the most dominant hitters in MLB. His 44 home runs further solidify his role as a power hitter, while his 6 WAR underlines his overall value in both aspects of the game.

### Record 2 Freddie Freeman (2023 Season)
**Raw Data:**
* WAR: 6.5
* OBP: .410
* SLG: .567
* PA: 730
* Hits: 211
* Doubles: 59

**Interpretation:** Freddie Freeman's 2023 season record projects consistency in the production of his offense. With an OBP of .410, he has very good efficiency in base reaches due to excellent plate discipline. His SLG of .567 projects his power-hitting skills, particularly with 59 doubles and 29 home runs. Freeman's 6.5 WAR further emphasizes his overall value both at offense and defense. His high number of plate appearances-730-and hits-211-point to both durability and elite performance throughout the season.

## Background Domain Knowledge
Analytics in baseball have transformed drastically over the course of two decades-from traditional statistics to an advanced metric for deep insight into the performance of players. This represents a sea change in the way talent is evaluated and decisions made on teams.

While the sport's quantitative underpinnings trace back to the 19th century with simple statistics such as batting average and earned run average, many of those traditional metrics really didn't capture the complete range of a player's contribution. Analytics is now modern, popularized in the early 2000s by Billy Beane's Oakland Athletics and their "Moneyball" approach, which stressed on-base percentage and other undervalued metrics.

Today's analytics of the game include advanced statistical models and technology-driven data collection. Installed in every MLB stadium, Statcast tracks everything from movement to exit velocity, giving unparalleled insight into player performance. Teams employ advanced algorithms that break down defensive positioning, pitch selection, and batting tendencies.

Advanced metrics have now integrated into the game, causing strategic shifts in how teams play the game. Teams give higher values to walks, and therefore pitch counts are up, as well as longer at-bats. Defensive shifts have aligned with highly detailed spray charts and batting tendencies. The "small ball" approach has given way to three-true-outcomes baseball-home runs, walks, and strikeouts-as analytics have shown the relative inefficiency of sacrifice bunts and stolen base attempts.

## Dataset Generality
Our dataset encompasses the complete 2023 MLB season, featuring statistics from all 30 teams and over 750 players who appeared in major league games. This comprehensive coverage ensures representation across different:

* Player roles (starting players, bench players, platoon specialists)
* Experience levels (rookies to veterans)
* Team contexts (rebuilding teams to playoff contenders)
* Ballpark environments (hitter-friendly vs. pitcher-friendly)
* Geographic regions (affecting playing conditions)

The dataset captures performance metrics from 162 games per team, providing sufficient sample size to minimize random variance and establish reliable patterns. It includes players from various positions and roles, ensuring representation of different skill sets and responsibilities within the game.

## Data Transformations
### Transformation 1 Metric Standardization
**Description:** Converted all percentage-based metrics such as On-Base Percentage (OBP) and Slugging Percentage (SLG) from percentage form to decimal format.

**Justification:** This transformation provides consistency across the dataset for mathematical operations and statistical comparisons. Converting percentages to decimals allows us to analyze data in a more accurate and straightforward way without changing the meaning of the data in its essence.

### Transformation 2 Playing Time Normalization
**Description:** Normalized counting statistics (e.g., Hits, Home Runs) to reflect per-600 plate appearance rates.

**Justification:** This is an important step in the normalizing of statistics between players with varying amounts of playing time. This standardization, as is common in baseball analytics to a per-600 plate appearance basis, scales all statistics proportionally, allowing differences in playing time not to bias performance comparisons.

### Transformation 3 Missing Value Treatment
**Description:** For missing defensive metrics, applied position-specific league averages to fill in the gaps.

**Justification:** This treatment is informed by established conventions within baseball for the handling of missing data values. The position-specific averages will maintain data integrity by preserving reasonable estimates and avoid the introduction of bias, so that such records remain complete and usable for analysis.


## Visualizations
1. Correlation Matrix: This matrix depicts the relationship of each performance metric to one another. Note that there are strong correlations between OBP and SLG. This would infer that most players who are good at getting on base tend to have higher slugging percentages.


2. Scatter Plot of WAR vs. SLG: The scatter plot shows a positive slope, which suggests that players with higher WAR values are likely to have higher SLG scores. That again would confirm that the well-rounded players do contribute much towards their teams both offensively and defensively.


3. OBP Distribution Histogram: The histogram exhibits right-skewed distribution in the values of OBP, reflecting the status of players who fall below most league averages regarding getting on base. That speaks volumes of how competitive MLB is.


4. Scatter Plot of PA vs. Hits: This plot shows a clear linear trend where the more plate appearances players have, the more hits they accumulate. That intuitively makes great sense and underlines the importance of opportunity in terms of individual success.


5. Distribution SLG Histogram: The SLG histogram is dominated by the high number of players that hit with a relatively low slugging percentage; there are a few outliers in this data that show really good power hitting. That there is such a variance in players' skills, from the consistent contact hitter to the power hitter.
