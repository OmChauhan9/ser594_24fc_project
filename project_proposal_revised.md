Author : Om Rajesh Chauhan

Date : 10/28/2024

Keywords : MLB Player Performance, Position-Specific Analytics, Defensive Impact on Offense

Description :

This work focuses on evaluating MLB player offensive performance metrics (including batting average, OBP, SLG, and WAR) within the context of their defensive positions. The project aims to understand how a player's defensive position correlates with their offensive output and career longevity. By analyzing position-specific performance patterns, this study will explore whether certain defensive positions show distinct offensive trends and how these patterns might influence player evaluation. This approach combines traditional offensive metrics with positional context to create a more nuanced understanding of player value.

Research Questions :

RO1: To describe the trends within MLB player offensive metrics across different defensive positions from 2023
RO2: To predict the value of a player's OPS (On-base Plus Slugging) based on their defensive position and other        offensive metrics
RO3: To defend the model for performing the prediction in RO2
RO4: To evaluate causal relationships implied by the RO2 model between defensive positions and offensive performance
RO5: To analyze position-specific offensive performance patterns and their implications for player evaluation

Intellectual Merit :

The project advances scientific knowledge by exploring the relationship between defensive positions and offensive performance in baseball. While many studies focus solely on offensive or defensive metrics in isolation, this project seeks to identify patterns and relationships between a player's defensive role and their offensive output. This unique perspective could provide new insights into position-specific performance expectations and player development patterns, potentially influencing how teams evaluate and develop players for specific positions.

Data Sourcing :

Data will be collected from Baseball-Reference and FanGraphs, focusing on player statistics from 2023. The dataset will include:

- Primary defensive position
- Traditional offensive metrics (BA, OBP, SLG, OPS)
- Advanced metrics (WAR, wRC+, ISO)
- Games played per position
- Plate appearances

The data will be accessed through their public APIs and web scraping tools, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all MLB players during the year 2023.
